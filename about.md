### What we are ?

- Intro about the sad history of skateboarding market
In the beginning, there were only rebels attaching some wheels to a plank of wood to surf down the streets on waveless days. 50 years later, skateboarding industry has grown hugely - nowadays it's considered an Olympic "sport", the skaters are considered "athletes" while Big Capital, Big Tech and Big Media make loads of money out of skaters' effort to land their tricks on unique spots. Despite that, millions of people practice skateboarding everyday around the world. And guess what, we are not even necessarily doing this for money.
Having fun, being around your friends and idols, shredding down the streets, bomb hilling, travelling to new places, getting to know more people, running away from our problems, getting more in peace with ouserlves...
That's why we skateboard.
 
- A community of skaters for skaters and people that like
Skatehive is a community from skaters to skaters and those who appreciate it in its all forms - street, longboard, vert, megaramp or whatever else. We have a dream, a big dream, and we are chasing it.

- We try move foward small skateboarding initiatives
Our passsion is seeing small initiatives all around the world getting down because of Skatehive interaction, supporting, sharing and **funding**.

- We dont like big tech and centralization++
As you might've already noticed, we don't like big tech and centralization.
It's not fair that Facebook, Google, Amazon etc get our data and content for free and sell all of that in a secondary market where we are treated as products.

Only two markets in the world call their customers by users:
Drug market and data market (Phrase taken from the Documentary "Social Dilemma" -link as well)

- We want bring awareness 
We want to bring awareness to everybody there, mainly skateboarders. 
It's our mission to discuss all those issues with our beloved ones, warn them about the threat to freedom of choice and to propose new forms of interacting in this modern, technological and globalized world.

- We want the control of our content and culture back
We want the control of our content and culture back.
We want to be free to watch what we want to watch, and not what somebody is paying me to watch without I don't even get a shit out of this money.
We want to write the story of our community, ours costumes and our culture.
